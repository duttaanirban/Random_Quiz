# Random Quiz App

A simple, dynamic quiz application built using HTML, Tailwind CSS, and JavaScript. The app generates random arithmetic questions, provides multiple-choice answers, tracks the user's score, and displays the final result at the end of the quiz.

## Features

- **Random Question Generation**: The quiz dynamically generates arithmetic questions involving addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- **Multiple Choices**: Each question comes with four possible answers, randomly shuffled, including one correct answer and three close distractors.
- **Score Tracking**: The app keeps track of the user's score and displays the total score at the end of the quiz.
- **Feedback**: Users receive immediate feedback after each question, indicating whether their answer was correct or wrong.
- **Responsive Design**: Built with Tailwind CSS, the app is responsive and user-friendly on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Quiz Restart**: Once the quiz is completed, users can restart the quiz with a fresh set of random questions.

## Installation and Setup

To get started with the Random Quiz App:

1. **Clone the repository** (or download the files):
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/random-quiz-app.git
    ```
2. **Navigate to the project folder**:
    ```bash
    cd random-quiz-app
    ```
3. **Open `index.html` in your browser**:
    Open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser to run the quiz app.

## How It Works

1. **Random Question Generation**: Each question is generated by randomly selecting two numbers and a basic arithmetic operator (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`). The answer choices include one correct answer and three incorrect answers, generated by small random offsets from the correct answer.
   
2. **Answer Checking**: When the user selects an answer, the app checks it against the correct answer and provides feedback immediately. The score is incremented for each correct answer.

3. **Final Score**: After all questions have been answered, the app displays the user's total score out of the number of questions attempted.

4. **Restarting the Quiz**: At the end of the quiz, users can restart the quiz, which will reload a new set of random questions.

## Files

- `index.html`: The main HTML file that contains the structure of the quiz app and The Tailwind CSS-powered stylesheet for styling the quiz app.
- `app.js`: Contains the JavaScript logic for generating questions, checking answers, tracking scores, and handling the quiz flow.

## Customization

To customize the quiz app, you can modify the following:

- **Number of Questions**: Change the `totalQuestions` variable in `app.js` to increase or decrease the number of questions in a single session.
- **Question Types**: Modify the `generateRandomQuestion` function in `app.js` to generate different types of questions (e.g., more complex arithmetic, vocabulary, or general knowledge).
- **Styling**: Adjust the Tailwind CSS classes in `index.html`.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Provides the structure of the quiz.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For responsive and modern styling.
- **JavaScript**: Handles question generation, answer checking, score tracking, and quiz flow.
